# bookmovie_app

## Brief
The aim of this project as specified in the brief is to create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools. It must have methodologies and technologies that encapsulates all core modules covered during the training. It is then to be assessed by the trainers who will assess the capabilities and concepts that were taught and assess the project against S.F.I.A. 
 In order to meet the requirements of the project I must display the following:
 * A Trello board displaying tasks in category of Completed, In progress, and etc. 

 * A relational database to store data persistently for the project. The database must contain at least 2 tables excluding a table displaying Users. 

 * A detailed risk assessment and a clear documentation from a design phase describing the architecture.  

 * A functional CRUD application created in Python which meets the requirements set in the Trello board. 

 * A high-test coverage in the backend providing a consistent report and evidence to support a TDD approach. 

 * A fully designed test suites for the project as well as a well automated tests for validation of the application.   

 * A functioning front-end website with integrated APIâ€™s using Flask. 

 * Code being fully integrated into a version control system using the feature-branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine. 
 
 ## Methods
 My attempt at achieving the requirements is through a movie and book app project that will allow the user to first: - 
 * Add books to sell 
   (Title, genre, year of release, Author, price).
 * Add movies to sell 
    (Title, genre, year of release, Director, price).
 * Search  and read about books to buy 

 * Search and read about movies to buy 

 * Update information about a movie or book 

 * Delete movie or book
